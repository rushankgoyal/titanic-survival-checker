## Titanic Survival Checker

## What it does
It has 3 parameters: Class (1st, 2nd or 3rd), Age, and Sex. It uses the Wolfram Cloud API to pass in these parameters and get an output which it then displays -- either "survived or "died"

## How I built it
I used a publicly available ML model hosted on Wolfram Cloud, and I coded an Android app to go along with it.

## Challenges I ran into
How to make the UI look appealing
Testing the ML model to check results

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am proud of the simplicity of the app. It is quite intuitive to use and fun to play with.

## What I learned
I learned how to use APIs integrated with the Wolfram Cloud service.
